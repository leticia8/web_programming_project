# Proyecto de Programaci√≥n Web, 2020

- [Runs on Netlify](meredixstudio.netlify.app/)
- Automatic deploys of the `master` branch using Github Actions.

## Contributing

`eslint` and `prettier` have been set up to take care of styling and code
formatting, using github actions to check every PR against `master`.

We merge PRs via _Squash and Merge (fast-forward)_, with all commits on master
following the [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard, also
checked for with a github-actions script.
